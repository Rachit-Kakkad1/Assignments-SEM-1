    <h3>Mobile payments made easy</h3>
    <p>
      Bitcoin when used on a mobile device allows you to pay with a simple two-step scan-and-pay.
      There's no need to sign up, swipe your card, type a PIN, or sign anything.
      All you need to receive Bitcoin payments is to display the QR code in your Bitcoin wallet app
      and let the other party scan your mobile, or touch the two phones together (using NFC radio technology).

    <h3>Security and control over your money</h3>
    <p>
      Bitcoin transactions are secured by mathematics and energy. 
      <a href="#">Cryptographic signatures</a> prevent other people from spending your money. 
      Energy spent by <a href="#">proof of work (PoW)</a> prevents other people from undoing, rearranging 
      or losing your transactions. So long as you take the required steps to 
      <a href="#">protect your wallet</a>, Bitcoin can give you control over your money 
      and a strong level of protection against many types of fraud.

    <h3>Works everywhere, anytime</h3>
    <p>
      Similarly to email, you don't need to ask recipients you're sending bitcoin to, to use the same software, wallets or service providers.
      You just need their bitcoin address and then you can transact with them anytime.
      The Bitcoin network is always running and never sleeps, even on weekends and holidays.

    <h3>Fast international payments</h3>
    <p>
      Sending bitcoins across borders is as easy as sending them across the street.
      There are no banks to make you wait three business days, no extra fees for
      making an international transfer, and no special limitations on the minimum
      or maximum amount you can send.

    <h3>Choose your own fees</h3>
    <p>
      There is no fee to receive bitcoins, and many wallets let you control how large a fee to pay when spending.
      Most wallets have reasonable default fees, and higher fees can encourage faster 
      <a href="#">confirmation</a> of your transactions. Fees are unrelated to the amount transferred,
      so it's possible to send 100,000 bitcoins for the same fee it costs to send 1 bitcoin.
