        <h1>Some things you need to know</h1>
        <p>
            If you're getting started with Bitcoin, there are a few things you should know.
            Bitcoin lets you exchange money and transact in a different way than you normally do.
            As such, you should take time to inform yourself before using Bitcoin for any serious
            transaction. Bitcoin should be treated with the same care as your regular wallet,
            or even more in some cases!

            <h2>Securing your wallet</h2>
            <p>
                Like in real life, your wallet must be secured. Bitcoin makes it possible to transfer
                value anywhere in a very easy way and it allows you to be in control of your money.
                Such great features also come with great security concerns. At the same time, Bitcoin
                can provide very high levels of security if used correctly. Always remember that it is
                your responsibility to adopt good practices in order to protect your money.

            <h2>Bitcoin price is volatile</h2>
            <p>
                The price of a bitcoin can unpredictably increase or decrease over a short period of
                time due to its young economy, novel nature, and sometimes illiquid markets.
                Consequently, keeping your savings with Bitcoin is not recommended at this point.
                Bitcoin should be seen like a high risk asset, and you should never store money that
                you cannot afford to lose with Bitcoin. If you receive payments with Bitcoin, many
                service providers can convert them to your local currency.

                <h2>Bitcoin payments are irreversible</h2>
                <p>
                    A Bitcoin transaction cannot be reversed, it can only be refunded by the person receiving the funds.
                    This means you should take care to do business with people and organizations you know and trust,
                    or who have an established reputation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For their part, businesses need to keep track of the payment requests they are displaying to their
                    customers.
                    Bitcoin can detect typos and usually won't let you send money to an invalid address by mistake,
                    but it's best to have controls in place for additional safety and redundancy.
                    Additional services might exist in the future to provide more choice and protection for both
                    businesses and consumers.

      <h2>Bitcoin is not anonymous</h2>
      <p>
        Some effort is required to protect your privacy with Bitcoin. 
        All Bitcoin transactions are stored publicly and permanently on the network, 
        which means anyone can see the balance and transactions of any Bitcoin address. 
        However, the identity of the user behind an address remains unknown until information 
        is revealed during a purchase or in other circumstances.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is one reason why Bitcoin addresses should only be used once. 
        Always remember that it is your responsibility to adopt good practices 
        in order to protect your privacy.

      <h2>Unconfirmed transactions aren't secure</h2>
      <p>
        Transactions don't start out as irreversible. Instead, they get a 
        <em>confirmation</em> score that indicates how hard it is to reverse them (see table). 
        Each confirmation takes between a few seconds and 90 minutes, with 10 minutes being the average. 
        If the transaction pays too low a fee or is otherwise atypical, getting the first confirmation can take much longer.
